## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern features
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **React Router** for client-side routing and navigation guards
- **Axios** for HTTP requests with interceptors and error handling
- **React Context** for global state management
- **React Hot Toast** for elegant user notifications

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Node.js + Express** with TypeScript for scalable server development
- **Knex.js** query builder for MySQL with migration management
- **JWT Authentication** with access/refresh token pattern
- **bcrypt** for secure password hashing
- **Winston** for structured logging
- **Helmet** for security headers
- **CORS** for secure cross-origin requests

### **Database & Infrastructure**
- **MySQL** relational database for complex relationships
- **Migration-based schema management** for version control
- **Connection pooling** for optimal database performance
- **Parameterized queries** for SQL injection prevention

### Key Architectural Choices

#### 1. Database & Query Layer
- **Knex.js over ORMs**: Chosen for direct SQL control, better performance understanding, and migration capabilities
- **MySQL**: Relational database for complex event-user relationships and data integrity
- **Migration-First Development**: Schema changes tracked and versioned through Knex migrations

#### 2. Authentication Architecture
- **Cookie-based JWT**: HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks while maintaining stateless authentication
- **Dual Token System**: 15-minute access tokens + 7-day refresh tokens for security and UX balance
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Background refresh prevents session interruptions
- **Route Protection**: Both frontend (React Router) and backend (Express middleware) authorization

#### 3. Frontend Architecture
- **Component Organization**: Pages grouped by feature (auth-pages/, event-page/) for maintainability
- **Custom Component Library**: Reusable CustomButton, CustomInput, CustomFormField for consistency
- **Context-Based State**: Authentication context for global auth state management
- **Error Boundaries**: Dedicated NotFound for user experience

#### 4. Backend Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Separate models, controllers, and routes for clean separation of concerns
- **Middleware Chain**: Authentication, validation, and error handling middleware
- **RESTful API Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes for predictable interface

### Security Implementation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **JWT Security**: Short-lived access tokens with secure refresh mechanism
- **Cookie Security**: HTTP-only, secure, SameSite cookies for CSRF protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Specific origin allowlist and credential support
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs and data integrity

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) 
- **MySQL** (v8.0 or higher)
- **npm** package manager (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for version control

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables:
```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=eventuser
DB_PASSWORD=eventpass
DB_NAME=event_planner

# JWT Security
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_super_secure_refresh_secret_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Email Configuration (for OTP verification)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
```

### Backend Setup
1. **Navigate to server directory and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:latest
   ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to client directory and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### Verification
- Backend: Visit `http://localhost:3001/api/health` to verify server is running
- Frontend: Visit `http://localhost:5173` to access the application
- Database: Check MySQL connection and verify tables are created
